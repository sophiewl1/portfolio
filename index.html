                        In this project on "Mental Health," we designed visuals for events at the fictional venue "Triptyque," including posters, a banner, and a flyer-poster featuring handwritten quotes and our own photography. By printing, crumpling, and re-digitizing these images, we symbolized the resilience and fragmentation of mental health experiences. <br><br>

                        Storyframing is a creative method that seamlessly combines storytelling and wireframing,
                        designed to breathe new life into the user experience of a website through the redesign
                        process. For this project, I undertook a comprehensive examination of the usability and user
                        experience of the old website, delving deep into user feedback and analytics to identify
                        pain points and areas for improvement. My analysis revealed not only the critical flaws in
                        navigation and content presentation but also illuminated opportunities to enhance user
                        engagement and satisfaction.<br><br>
                        To bring my vision to life, I illustrated a series of placeholder images, carefully selected
                        to reflect the intended aesthetic and thematic elements of the redesigned website. These
                        visuals were strategically inserted into the prototype, creating a cohesive and inviting
                        look and feel that guided the userâ€™s journey. Ultimately, I implemented the clickable
                        prototype using Adobe XD, which allowed for interactive testing and validation of design
                        concepts, ensuring that the final product would resonate with users and meet their needs
                        effectively. <br><br>

                    <p class="text">
                        For the functional Norwegian brand Fjelltur, my task was to create a color palette that
                        resonates with the essence of the brand. To achieve this, I decided to draw inspiration from
                        the breathtaking landscapes of Norway, carefully selecting colors that reflect its natural
                        beauty. I sifted through a collection of stunning photographs and discovered remarkable
                        color combinations that encapsulated the serene yet vibrant essence of the Norwegian
                        outdoors. <br><br>
                        These carefully chosen hues were intended to be integrated into a product design, for which
                        I selected a hiking backpack that embodies both functionality and style. The design aimed
                        not only to provide practical solutions for outdoor enthusiasts but also to evoke a sense of
                        connection to nature with every use. By incorporating these colors, I envisioned a product
                        that not only serves its purpose but also tells a story of adventure and exploration,
                        encouraging users to embrace the great outdoors with confidence and flair. <br><br>

                        In this photography course, the final assignment required us to create five portrait images,
                        allowing us the freedom to choose our own theme. I chose to photograph my grandmother,
                        capturing her in various poses and settings within the comfort of her home. <br><br>
                        The narrative followed her as she explored an old photo album, reminiscing nostalgically
                        over images from her wedding day. This intimate moment revealed not just her memories but
                        also the rich history woven into those photographs. To enhance the visual storytelling, I
                        meticulously edited the images using Lightroom and Photoshop, ensuring that the colors and
                        contrasts reflected the warmth of her memories. The final result was a heartfelt tribute to
                        her past, encapsulating a beautiful blend of emotion and artistry that transcended the mere
                        act of photography. <br><br>

                        In this typography and layout course, we were tasked with selecting a typeface and creating
                        a typography poster that showcased our design skills. I embarked on this project by
                        developing several layouts, each embodying different approaches and design philosophies. One
                        concept was bold and striking, featuring expansive areas of black space, while another
                        embraced a playful, minimalist style that celebrated the beauty of simplicity. Additionally,
                        I explored a dynamic color scheme that brought the typography to life. <br><br>
                        The poster was designed to include not only the complete alphabet but also various special
                        characters and font weights, providing a comprehensive overview of the typeface. To further
                        enrich the design, I incorporated intriguing sentences that delved into the history and
                        evolution of the font, highlighting its significance in the world of design. Ultimately,
                        this project allowed me to experiment with creativity and form, deepening my appreciation
                        for the art of typography. <br><br>

                        In this project, the task was to recreate a series of still lifes, some of which I photographed myself. Using Procreate, I reinterpreted these still lifes in an abstract style, capturing their essence with bold strokes and unique shapes. <br><br>
                        Each image transformed into a study of color and form, pushing the boundaries of realism into abstraction.
                        After completing the drawings, I designed striking posters for each piece, emphasizing contrasting elements to make each artwork stand out. Every poster became its own visual story, highlighting the interplay of light, shadow, and composition in unexpected ways. <br><br>
