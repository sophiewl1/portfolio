                        I grew up in a small town and discovered my passion for painting early on. I often spent hours
                        with brushes and canvases, and I regularly attended an art school to improve my skills. After
                        the 10th grade, I decided
                        to switch from a traditional high school to a technical high school to focus on my
                        specialization in Design
                        and Media Technology. Even back then, I knew I wanted to pursue a creative career. <br><br>

                        After graduating from high school, I completed a two-year apprenticeship as a media designer at
                        a medium-sized advertising agency. This time was very educational, and I gained valuable
                        practical
                        experience. During my apprenticeship, I knew I wanted to study further, but I was still unsure
                        about the specific field. <br><br>

                        When I discovered the University of Media, I immediately knew it was the right choice for me. I
                        was thrilled when I received my acceptance letter. I moved to Stuttgart for my studies and
                        quickly felt at home there.
                        I thoroughly enjoy my studies, as they involve many creative aspects and focus heavily on user
                        experience.<br><br>

                        During my practical semester, I had the opportunity to work at a renowned advertising agency in
                        Stuttgart, which is the lead agency for Mercedes Benz Vans. This experience was incredibly
                        enriching and further enhanced my practical skills. Now, I am in my sixth semester and look
                        forward to expanding my knowledge and skills even further through a semester abroad. <br><br>

                        My journey has been marked by many creative milestones, and I am excited to see what new
                        opportunities and challenges the future holds for me.
